# Portal

The makeshift portal we made for the CTF event. 

## Setup

To run this portal you need python and Flask installed on your system.
```
pip install flask
```

Then to start the portal

```
python portal.py
```
The website should be up and running on `http://localhost:8000`

## Submit answers

To submit answer for a question X, goto `http://localhost:8000/X`

eg: For question 1, goto `http://localhost:8000/1`

Keep trying your answers till you get to success page.


## Warning:
*Beacuse we are lazy people, the answers for the questions have been hardcoded into the python file. If you are making any actual application never do this.*
